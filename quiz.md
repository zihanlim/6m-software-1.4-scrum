### Q8: Which sentence is false in describing the difference between sprint backlog and product backlog?

- A: Product backlog contains user stories to be completed in the future sprint.
- B: Sprint backlog contains user stories to be completed in the current sprint.
- C: Product backlog typically describes the entire features of the product to date.
- XD: Sprint backlog contains only the outstanding user stories from previous sprint.
  The sprint backlog is a list of tasks and achievables for the current sprint, just one period of activity in the project. It is created during the sprint planning meeting and contains only the product backlog items that can be completed during the sprint. The sprint backlog is not a list of outstanding user stories from previous sprints.

The product backlog, on the other hand, is a list of all the features and functionality that the product should have. It is a living document that is constantly being updated as the product evolves. The product backlog contains user stories, which are descriptions of features or functionality from the perspective of the end user.

### Q10: Which of the following does not describe the purpose of retrospective meeting?

- A: Discuss what has worked well in the closing sprint.
- B: Discuss what can be improved.
- C: Decide what can be implemented susintability.
- XD: All improvements should be implemented immediately in the next sprint.
  The purpose of a retrospective meeting is to discuss what went well and what can be improved in the current sprint. The team should identify any areas where they can improve their process, communication, or collaboration. They should also decide how to implement these improvements in a sustainable way.

It is not realistic to expect that all improvements can be implemented immediately in the next sprint. Some improvements may require more time or resources. The team should prioritize the improvements and make a plan for implementing them in the next sprint or sprints.

Here are some of the benefits of retrospective meetings:

They help teams identify and address problems early on.
They help teams learn from their mistakes and improve their processes.
They help teams build trust and camaraderie.
They help teams stay focused on their goals.
If you are a Scrum Master or team member, I encourage you to make the most of your retrospective meetings. They are a valuable opportunity to improve your team's performance and deliver better products.
