Q1: Describe the Waterfall Model.
The waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach to the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that is popular in software engineering and product development.
The waterfall model is a breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases, meaning they are passed down onto each other, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialization of tasks.

Projects based on the waterfall model are well defined, predictable and have specific documentation. They also have the following characteristics:

-fixed requirements;
-ample resources;
-an established timeline;
-well-understood technology; and
-unlikely to require significant changes.

Waterfall
1.Requirements. Potential requirements, deadlines and guidelines for the project are analyzed and placed into a formal requirements document, also called a functional specification. This stage of development defines and plans the project without mentioning specific processes.

2.Analysis. The system specifications are analyzed to generate product models and business logic to guide production. This is also when financial and technical resources are audited for feasibility.

3.Design. A design specification document is created to outline technical design requirements, such as the programming language, hardware, data sources, architecture and services.

4.Coding and implementation. The source code is developed using the models, logic and requirement specifications designated in the prior phases. Typically, the system is coded in smaller components, or units, before being put together.

5.Testing. This is when quality assurance, unit, system and beta tests identify issues that must be resolved. This may cause a forced repeat of the coding stage for debugging. If the system passes integration and testing, the waterfall continues forward.

6.Operation and deployment. The product or application is deemed fully functional and is deployed to a live environment.

7.Maintenance. Corrective, adaptive and perfective maintenance is carried out indefinitely to improve, update and enhance the product and its functionality. This could include releasing patch updates and new versions.

Q2: Describe the Agile Model.
a combination of iterative and incremental process models with focus on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working software product. Agile Methods break the product into small incremental builds. These builds are provided in iterations. Each iteration typically lasts from about one to three weeks. Every iteration involves cross functional teams working simultaneously on various areas like âˆ’

-Planning
-Requirements Analysis
-Design
-Coding
-Unit Testing and
-Acceptance Testing.

Q3: Describe the difference between Waterfall and Agile model.
Agile model is based on adaptive software development methods, whereas the traditional SDLC models like the waterfall model is based on a predictive approach. Predictive teams in the traditional SDLC models usually work with detailed planning and have a complete forecast of the exact tasks and features to be delivered in the next few months or during the product life cycle.

Predictive methods entirely depend on the requirement analysis and planning done in the beginning of cycle. Any changes to be incorporated go through a strict change control management and prioritization.

Agile uses an adaptive approach where there is no detailed planning and there is clarity on future tasks only in respect of what features need to be developed. There is feature driven development and the team adapts to the changing product requirements dynamically. The product is tested very frequently, through the release iterations, minimizing the risk of any major failures in future.

Customer Interaction is the backbone of this Agile methodology, and open communication with minimum documentation are the typical features of Agile development environment. The agile teams work in close collaboration with each other and are most often located in the same geographical location.

## Part 1 - All Agile Methodologies

The most popular Agile Methodology is SCRUM, but it is not the only methodology.

### The Agile Manifesto

<img src="./assets/manifesto.png" />

1. Processes and Tools are not as agile as human beings.
1. Intuitive software is better than excessive documentation.
1. Collaboration ensures product development is aligned with end users' requirement.
1. When business change, the tech team must adapt.

## Part 2 - SCRUM

SCRUM is one of the many Agile Methodologies.

In SCRUM, there are four meetings:

1. _Sprint Planning_ - Laying out the work to be performed for the sprint. (4 to 8 hours)
1. _Daily Scrum_ - Inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal. (15 mins)
1. _Sprint Review_ - Inspect the outcome of the Sprint. (1 to 4 hours)
1. _Sprint Retrospective_ - Plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. (1 to 3 hours)

## Part 3 - Class Activity (What are agile user stories?)

| Action                                                                                                  | Duration | Outcome                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Learners self Reading for this [link](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories). | 10 mins  | Learners have a brief understanding of what agile user stories are. |
| Instructor facilitate students to answer three questions by getting students to type in chat.           | 20 mins  | Summarizes and highlight the good inputs from student.              |

Three Questions:

1. What are user stories?
1. Why user stories?
1. Think and provide an example of a user story.
